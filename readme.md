# Caesar Cipher GUI Application

This is a simple GUI application built with Tkinter that allows users to `encrypt` and `decrypt` messages using the Caesar Cipher technique.

The application includes the following features:
- An input field for the message to be encrypted or decrypted
- An input field for the shift value
- Buttons to trigger encryption or decryption of the input message
- An output label to display the result of the encryption or decryption
- The encrypted or decrypted text can be copied to the clipboard by clicking the encryption or decryption button.

## Installation

- Install the required dependencies using pip: `pip install tkinter pyperclip`

## How to Use

1. Enter the message you want to encrypt or decrypt into the "Enter the text to encrypt/decrypt" input field.
2. Enter the shift value into the "Enter the shift number" input field. This specifies how many letters to shift in the alphabet.
3. Click the `Encrypt` button to encrypt the message or the `Decrypt` button to decrypt the message.
4. The encrypted or decrypted text will be displayed in the "The encrypted/decrypted text is:" output label.
5. You can `quickly paste the encrypted or decrypted text` anywhere after clicking the "Encrypt" or "Decrypt" button respectively.
